A Graph is non-linear DS consisting of a finite set of nodes and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes.

            (0)___________(3)\
             |             |  \
             |             |   (5)
             |             |  /
            (1)___________(2)/

1. Adjacency Matrix --> uses 2D array 
2. Adjacency List  --> uses 2D vector

see implementation.cpp for more..

--> Traversal

1) BFS : Breadth first Search
1)uses queue
2)prints adjacent elements first


|| Biparsite graphs ||
the graph which can be coloured using exactly 2 colors but 2 adjecent nodes shouldn't have same color
(bookish: a bipartite graph is graph which can be devided into two sets such that no edge connects the elements of the same set)

g -> green , b --> blue

          (g)-(b)
          /     \
(b)-(g)-(b)     (g)-(b)-(g) ----> bipartite
          \     /
          (g)-(b)

            (g)
          /     \
(b)-(g)-(b)     (b)-(g)-(b) ----> non-bipartite
          \     /
          (g)-(b)

obersevation:
odd length cycle --> non-bipartite
else --> bipartite

|| Topological Sorting ||

Linear ordering of vertices such that if u->v , u appears before v in the ordering

(5)-->(0)<--(4)
 |           |
 v           v
(2)-->(3)-->(1)

Topological sort :: 5 4 3 2 1 0 or 4 5 2 3 1 0
Topological sort is only applicable for DAG ==> Directed Acyclic Graph


First let's review some statement for tree in graph theory:

(1) A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are
connected by exactly one path.

(2) Any connected graph who has n nodes with n-1 edges is a tree.

(3) The degree of a vertex of a graph is the number of
edges incident to the vertex.

(4) A leaf is a vertex of degree 1. An internal vertex is a vertex of
degree at least 2.

(5) A path graph is a tree with two or more vertices that is not
branched at all.

(6) A tree is called a rooted tree if one vertex has been designated
the root.

(7) The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest
downward path between root and a leaf.
