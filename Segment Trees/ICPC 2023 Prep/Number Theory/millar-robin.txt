Fermat's little theorom:
    if n is a prime number then for every a where, 1 < a < n-1;
    a^n-1 % n = 1 !!!

This is correct for every prime number
but error in returning true/false for composite exists.

Millar-Robin
it returns false if n is composite and true is n is probably prime.
k determines the accuracy level

bool isPrime(int n, int k)
1)handle both cases for n<3
2)if n is even return false
3)find an odd number d such that d*(2^r) = n-1 (where n is odd and r > 0)
4)do following k times
    if millerTest(n,d) ==  false return false
5)return true
