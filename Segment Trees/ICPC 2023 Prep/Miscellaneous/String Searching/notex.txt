Hash Function

creating a unique hash for a unique string
hash can be anything to make a string unique

a --> 1 / initialised with 1 and not 0 becoz multipling with 0 will result in 0 thus no unique hash
b --> 2
.
.
.
z --> 26

k = any number (but greater than 26)
so abcz = 1*k^0 + 2*k^1 + 3*k^3 + 26*k^4
but problem --> it grows Exponentially !!
so,
mod with 1e9+7;
now,
p^i * hash[i...j] = hash[0..j]-hash[0....i-1];
  
|| Substr function ||

string.substr(size_t pos = 0, size_t len = npos)

returns the string that starts at character position  pos and spans len characters (or until the end of the string,whichever comes first)

TC is O(ST)
now appling KMP will change it to O(S+T)
