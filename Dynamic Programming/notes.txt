Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
                                                    - Dynamic Programming

1)Tabulation way --> bottom up
2)Memorization way --> Top down

||How to know a DP problem||
1)count total ways
2)min/max/optimal way
try all ways possible....and count yes it's DP


||Tip||
1)represent the problem in terms of index
2)Do all possible stuff to that index according to problem statement


|| Fibonacci using DP ||

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21...

overlapping subproblems --> we dont need to solve again and again, we tend to store and memorise the values !!
recurrsion needs top down , n to base case..

|| Printing Subsequnces||

pick non pick method:
    









|| DP on Grids/ 2D DP ||

1)count paths
2)count paths with obstacles
3)min paths sum
4)max paths sum
5)triangles
6)2 start points

steps:
1)express in terms of (i,j)
2)Do all stuffs
3)sum up all ways
